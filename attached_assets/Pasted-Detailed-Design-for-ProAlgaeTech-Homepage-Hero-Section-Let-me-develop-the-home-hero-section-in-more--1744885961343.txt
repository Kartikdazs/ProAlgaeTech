Detailed Design for ProAlgaeTech Homepage Hero Section
Let me develop the home/hero section in more detail. This will be the first thing visitors see, so it should make a strong impression while clearly communicating what ProAlgaeTech does.
Hero Section Components
Header Navigation Bar

Position: Fixed at top
Style: Semi-transparent with gradient effect (teal to algae green)
Elements:

Left: ProAlgaeTech logo (stylized text with a small algae icon)
Right: Navigation menu with hover effects that resemble water ripples

Mobile: Hamburger menu icon that transforms into bubbles when clicked



Main Hero Visual

Background: Layered design with 3 elements:

Base layer: Gradient from deep teal (#006064) to vibrant algae green (#38B09D)
Middle layer: Soft, translucent video loop showing actual algae gently moving in water
Top layer: Animated floating micro-bubbles and particle effects representing microalgae



Hero Content

Headline: Large, bold text that fades in: "Algae are the diverse and potential organisms for the future economy"
Subheading: Smaller text appearing after headline: "Harnessing nature's green potential for sustainable solutions"
Call-to-Action: Two buttons side by side:

"Discover Our Solutions" - Primary button with vibrant green background
"Learn About Algae" - Secondary button with transparent background and teal border


Both buttons have subtle wave animation on hover



Animated Elements

Floating Algae Cells: 5-7 highly detailed, semi-transparent illustrations of different algae cells floating slowly across the screen
Counter Statistics: Animated counter showing:

"X+ Years Experience"
"Y+ Successful Projects"
"Z+ Algae Strains"


Scroll Indicator: Subtle animated arrow or wave pattern at the bottom suggesting users scroll down

Transition to About Section

As the user scrolls down, the hero section transitions with a wave-like effect
The wave "wipes" upward to reveal the About section
Some of the floating algae elements continue to float up into the about section, creating continuity

Technical Implementation Details

Parallax Effect: Background layers move at different speeds while scrolling
Performance Optimization: The video background automatically pauses when not in view
Accessibility: All animated elements have reduced motion options for users who prefer less movement
Responsiveness: On mobile, the layout adjusts to a vertical stack with appropriately sized elements

Interactive Feature

Mouse/Touch Interaction: The floating algae particles subtly respond to cursor movement or touch, moving slightly away from the pointer
Information Tooltips: When hovering over an algae cell for 2 seconds, a small information card appears with the name and a brief fact about that algae type
